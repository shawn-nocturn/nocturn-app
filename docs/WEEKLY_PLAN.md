## Key Dependencies / Setup Tasks
- [ ] Create Supabase project at supabase.com
- [ ] Set up Stripe Connect platform account
- [ ] Configure Resend domain (nocturn.app or similar)
- [ ] Set up Sentry for error monitoring
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Vercel

## Build Session Tips (for 9-5 schedule)
- **Weeknight sessions (2-3 hrs):** Focus on one feature at a time. Start with the data model, then the API, then the UI.
- **Weekend sessions (4-6 hrs):** Tackle larger features (Stripe integration, settlement engine).
- **Use Claude Code for acceleration:** Have Claude write the boilerplate, you focus on product decisions and UX.
- **Test with real data early:** Create a test collective and run through flows yourself before demo day.
